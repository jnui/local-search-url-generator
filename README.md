# local-search-url-generator
Generate a google search query with a location - easier than typing it in

# notes
This page is javascript only, no serverside code required (even tho it is saved as .php)

This is a tool to help create a local search. You enter your search query like "emergency plumbers" and in the second field start typing your location "Hous", it will autocomplete "Houston TX, USA"
Once you select a location, or click find, a URL will be created that you can click on to see the results as if you were
in the Houston TX area.
